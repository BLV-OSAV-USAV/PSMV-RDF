# Contributing to PSMV-RDF

We welcome contributions to the PSMV-RDF project. To ensure a smooth collaboration and maintain code quality, please adhere to the following workflow.

## Open an issue

Before writing any code, **open a GitHub Issue** to discuss the proposed change.
Whether it is a bug fix, feature request, or architectural adjustment, establish the scope in an issue first.

## Create a branch

Create a new branch for your specific task. Let GitHub autogenerate the branch name based on an issue; that way it's clear what you're trying to do on said branch.

## Submit a pull request

Once your work is ready:

1. Open a draft PR against the `main` branch.
2. Summarize your changes clearly in the description.
3. Link the PR to the issue it resolves (e.g. `Closes #42`).
4. Ensure there are no merge conflicts and all tests are passed before you change to status to standard pull request.
